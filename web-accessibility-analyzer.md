# Web Accessibility Analyzer API

## Product Overview

The **Web Accessibility Analyzer API** is a comprehensive tool designed to help developers, designers, and accessibility professionals identify and fix accessibility issues on websites. Built with modern web technologies, it provides automated analysis of web pages and AI-powered suggestions for improving accessibility compliance.

## What This Product Does

### Core Functionality

The API analyzes websites for three critical accessibility areas:

#### 1. üñºÔ∏è **Image Accessibility Analysis (AltSense)**
- **Detects missing alt attributes** on images
- **Identifies vague or non-descriptive alt text** (e.g., "image", "photo", "picture")
- **Provides actionable recommendations** for meaningful alt text
- **Supports all image formats** found in HTML `<img>` tags

#### 2. üîó **Link Accessibility Analysis (LinkSense)**
- **Analyzes anchor tag accessibility** across multiple dimensions:
  - **Descriptive Link Text**: Identifies non-descriptive links like "click here", "read more"
  - **External Link Handling**: Checks if external links properly use `target="_blank"`
  - **Proper Link Usage**: Validates correct use of `href` attributes
  - **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensures links are accessible via keyboard
- **Provides context-aware suggestions** for each identified issue

#### 3. ü§ñ **AI-Powered Suggestions (GeminiSense)**
- **Leverages Google's Gemini AI** to provide expert accessibility recommendations
- **Context-aware suggestions** based on specific element issues
- **Practical, actionable advice** tailored to each accessibility problem
- **Expert-level guidance** for complex accessibility scenarios
